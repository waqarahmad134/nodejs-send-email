"In this repository, I have also included a Vercel configuration. If you want to deploy your project on Vercel and run this API without any hosting costs, simply fork this repository and use your Vercel account. By selecting this repository in Vercel, your Node.js project will be live on Vercel, and you can manage the API from there. For example, if you forget to access the API at https://nodejs-send-email.vercel.co, your API endpoint will be https://nodejs-send-email.vercel.co/sendmail."
